# BK-ASM
A Collection of Assembly Hacks that I wrote for Banjo-Kazooie

### BK-QTE
This ROM-Hack attempts to start Quicktime Events in adjustable time intervalls. You will recieve a 1HP penalty for pressing wrong Buttons, and a 2HP penalty for failing an Event alltogether. The newest version has you press the ABZLR Buttons, and it comes with an Executable that lets you adjust the frequency and chance at which the QTEs appear. Simply apply either the xdelta or flips (bps) patch to a vanilla NTSC-U 1.0 BK ROM, and start the exe in the same directory as the patched ROM. Make sure that the patched ROM is called "BK-QTE.z64" too, or the exe wont accept it.
